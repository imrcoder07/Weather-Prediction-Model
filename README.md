# 🌦️ Weather Prediction System using Machine Learning

This project is a **Flask-based web application** that predicts future temperatures using historical weather data and a machine learning model. It also stores past weather readings and presents them through interactive charts.

---

## 📌 Features

- 📈 Predict future temperature using ML (e.g., Linear Regression)
- 🌡️ Store & display real-time weather data (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure)
- 📊 Interactive graphs for past 7-day weather and predicted trends
- 🧠 Model trained on custom historical dataset
- 🎨 Frontend built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind or custom), and JavaScript
